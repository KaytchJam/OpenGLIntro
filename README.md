# OpenGLIntro

## A Collection of Projects as I try to learn OpenGL

#### OpenGLIntro

Based on TheCherno's intro to OpenGL series, largely be just following along

#### Learn Open GL

Based on the Learn Open GL book/guides. A bit more of a freeform way for me to work along and figure out how openGL works.

#### Segmented Display Simulator

Trying to put what I learnt into practice. A simulator for a Seven Segmented Display (may be more than 7 in the future).
